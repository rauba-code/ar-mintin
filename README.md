# AR-MINTIN

Part of work-in-progress Ar productivity suite.

**Notice.** This repository contains only the core-functioning library. To use it as an application, you may be interested in AR-MINTIN-CLI ([GitHub link](https://github.com/rauba-code/ar-mintin-cli))

## Description

This is a simple learning application with a flashcards-like design of learning key-value pairs. The business logic is almost an exact remake of an old Win32 application, which was developed from 2015 to 2017.

It follows KISS (Keep It Simple and Stupid) principle, do not expect much from it.
